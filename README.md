# 🌍 Planet Diseases Detection

This project is an AI-driven tool for detecting and classifying diseases affecting crops and plants based on leaf imagery. Leveraging cutting-edge deep learning techniques, this model aims to support farmers, agricultural researchers, and environmental agencies in early identification of plant diseases, enabling effective interventions to prevent crop loss and mitigate environmental impact.
